# My Story

## The Background

At the end of 2018, I knew I had a problem. I had just reached my fifth year of professional software development. I'd worked as a Software Consultant serving dozens of clients in small, medium, and Fortune 500 companies under three consultancies. I had a great career with upwards mobility in the field I loved. My opinion was being sought after as a front-line technical expert on my projects. In spite of it all, I wasn't fulfilled.

#### I realized that being another technical resource to large, well-budgeted companies wasn't allowing me to help those who most needed my work.

That first pivotal day came when I realized that my desk job gave me a powerful opportunity. I was accustomed to working to music, but who knew or cared what I was actually listening to so long as I was able to keep delivering high-quality work?

Over the next 6 months, I listened to every YouTube video or podcast I could on the topics that might show me a way to realize my goals. I dug deep into investing, personal finance, world finance, and business. Ultimately, I figured out exactly what I wanted and started planning how I could get it.

> What I *wanted* was to hep those who dared to try new things succeed in business and in software!

## The Jump

Eventually, I realized that my personal values made me better suited for more independent work than I was doing. I started thinking of many potential business ideas. Finally, I put my corporate career behind me. My plan was to try to provide freelancing services with a special focus on the entrepreneurs who needed my skills the most.

## My First Rodeo

As soon as I left corporate, I spent all day, every day focusing on building my personal network - and for months. I went to any event that I could where entrepreneurs were likely to be. I went to startup meetups, angel and VC investor conferences, and tech accelerator programs. What I found blew me away - practically *every* entrepreneur was interested in attracting someone like me to help them with their startup!

In the end, I found two startups and decided to try both as a potential technical cofounder. After a few months, I picked one and strapped myself in for my first experience as a technical co-founder. In the process, I learned, made a lot of mistakes, and over time completely changed my opinions on what really matters to launch a successful new business.

## Scale

Early into my journey as a co-founder, I learned that it's an all-consuming job. I saw that the lack of good technical expertise earlier in the development process was risking sinking the ship while still in the harbor for many fledgling enterprises. But, I couldn't personally take the wheel for so many ships.  

I realized that the only way I would be able to share my needed expertise with those who needed it most was by putting the most important lessons I learned about software and business out there where they could be found. I decided to go for it!

## Now What?

My goal is to create a resource for building better software and more successful new businesses. Many of these lessons are hard-won through personal failures, and many are built on the shoulders of giants. Here you'll find what I've found the most useful for my own projects and ventures. I hope it helps!

Welcome to the community. I hope you build something!
