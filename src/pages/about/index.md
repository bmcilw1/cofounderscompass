  Hi there, and thanks for checking out the site!

  My name is Brian McIlwain, and I've devoted myself to helping startups succeed through software. You may be the aspiring entrepreneur trying to see if technology could help you achieve your vision. Perhaps you're actively looking for someone who can help you build your dream. You may be technical and looking to improve yourself- perhaps you're interested in the idea of founding a technology company but you're not sure where to start. Maybe you just feel like you could do better for yourself than the job you have now.

  For all of these people and anyone else who can be benefited by a mindset that teaches you how to get what you want through leveraging the technology of our day - this resource is for you.

# My Story

## The Background

At the end of 2018 I knew I had a problem. I had just reached my fifth year of professional software development. I'd worked as a Software Consultant under three consultancies and served dozens of clients across small, medium, and Fortune 500 companies. I had a great career with excellent upwards mobility in the field I wanted. I was looked to as an expert on all of my projects. In spite of everything, I wasn't happy.

#### What's more, I realized that I wouldn't be happy helping large, well-budgeted companies solve problems dozens of consultancies could help them with.

That fist pivotal day came when when I realized that my job gave me a powerful opportunity. I was accustomed to work to music, but who knew or cared what I was actually listening to so long as I was able to keep delivering high-quality work?

Over the next 6 months, I listened to every YouTube video or podcast I could on the topics that interested me. I dug deep into investing, personal finance, world finance, and finally business. In those 6 months, I figured out exactly what I wanted and started planning how I could get it.

> What I _wanted most_ was to help those who found themselves left out of their economies learn the mindset that would show them how they could win access to them for themselves.
