  Hello,

  My name is Brian McIlwain, and I've devoted myself to helping co-founders succeed in software and in business. You may be the aspiring entrepreneur trying to see if technology could help you achieve your vision. Perhaps you're actively looking for someone who can help you build your dream. You may be technical and looking to improve yourself. Perhaps you're interested in the idea of founding a tech company- but you're not sure where to gain the non-technical skills you'll need.

  For all of those who can be benefited by a mindset that teaches you how to realize your vision through leveraging the technology of our day - this resource is for you. Welcome.

# My Story

## The Background

At the end of 2018 I knew I had a problem. I had just reached my fifth year of professional software development. I'd worked as a Software Consultant serving dozens of clients in small, medium, and Fortune 500 companies under three consultancies. I had a great career with upwards mobility in the field I loved. My opinion was sought after as a front-line technical expert for my projects. In spite of it all, I wasn't fulfilled.

#### I realized that being another technical resource to large, well-budgeted companies wouldn't help me reach the audience I deeply wanted to help.

That first pivotal day came when when I realized that my desk job gave me a powerful opportunity. I was accustomed to work to music, but who knew or cared what I was actually listening to so long as I was able to keep delivering high-quality work?

Over the next 6 months, I listened to every YouTube video or podcast I could on the topics that might show me a way to realize my goals. I dug deep into investing, personal finance, world finance, and business. Ultimately, I figured out exactly what I wanted and started planning how I could get it.

> What I _wanted most_ was to share a mindset with those who felt left out of their economy that could teach them how to earn that access for themselves.
